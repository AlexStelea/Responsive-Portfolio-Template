<p>It all started with a "What if ". What if the newly released iPad and onset of social network could change and influence our world, and especially in the field of education. In hindsight, our vision is always 20/20, but at the time I examined a very controversial topic that few people were willing to accept the concepts of MOOC's and tablets. I discussed the use of social media and tablet technology in revolutionizing classroom technology, a talk that was very well received.

<p>Life is not always about personal opportunities; I realized that working on software engineering for the improvement of society was a fantastic combination. My research lab at Georgia Tech focuses on international development and technology and I specialize on Aggie, a social media analytics and tracking software used in elections in Nigeria, Libya, and Kenya. It is a very powerful visualization software; my role being to redesign, create, and maintain the new and improved Aggie 2.0. I'm very excited to work on a project that can directly touch and improve living conditions and corruption in those regions.
