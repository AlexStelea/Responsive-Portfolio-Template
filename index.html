	<div class="words-of-truth">
		<p><strong>People are a key part of my life, both personally and professionaly. I'm always open to try new tasks and mistakes are my favorite learning opportunities. I truly believe in everything I create, and I try to reflect my passion through all my projects.  My career is guided by a simple quote: "It's nice to be important, but it's more important to be nice."</strong></p>

				<p>Prezi has been an incredible experience for me, I have seen this company grow from a million users to over 25 million in the two years I have been with. I have impacted many aspects of this company from finance, marketing, support, and lately product development. Working with some brilliant minds and individuals has made me understand the struggles of being successful; a fact that Prezi has been cash flow positive since the first year of operation.

				<p>It all started with a "What if". What if the newly released iPad and onset of social network could change and influence our world, and especially in the field of education. In hindsight, our vision is always 20/20, but at the time I examined a very controversial topic that few people were willing to accept the concepts of MOOC's and tablets. I discussed the use of social media and tablet technology in revolutionizing classroom technology, a talk that was very well received.

				<p>Life is not always about personal opportunities; I realized that working on software engineering for the improvement of society was a fantastic combination. My research lab at Georgia Tech focuses on international development and technology and I specialize on Aggie, a social media analytics and tracking software used in elections in Nigeria, Libya, and Kenya. It is a very powerful visualization software;  my role being  to redesign, create, and maintain the new and improved Aggie 2.0. I'm very excited to work on a project that can directly touch and improve living conditions and corruption in those regions.

Apple featured both my applications for CP Greece in the New & Noteworthy categories at the time of launch.
